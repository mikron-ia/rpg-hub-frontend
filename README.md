# RPG hub
A system for role-playing game story/campaign/epic management. This repository is the frontend.

## Background
[Role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game) are a very wide category, ranging from very simplistic systems to extremely complex mechanical solutions. What they do have in common, though, is the story - you can play a game without mechanics, but even a primitive dungeon crawl is going to have some story. Managing this story, its cast, threads, and - if present - mechanical components - is the role of this project.

The project is currently split in two parts - [backend](https://github.com/mikron-ia/rpg-hub-backend) and frontend. It is possible that the split will increase once some functionality requires it.

Frontend is being written in AngularJS. Mind you, this is my first project written entirely in AngularJS, therefore it is **not** a valid resource or example for anything (except maybe bad practices). Data to fuel the frontend will be retrieved from API provided by backend.

## Development

## Installation guide
... will be created once the project does anything except passing tests.
